    <div class="what">
      <p>A Micro:bit is a compact multipurpose all in one microcontroller, this means that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It can run code that you program for it.</li>
        <li>It can run one line of code at a time.</li>
        <li>It has everything you need to run a program (inputs & outputs)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But most of all, the Micro:Bit is a learning tool. It is designed to help students learn how to code.</p>

      <h2>Coding Practice</h2>
      <p>The first, & most common use for the Micro:Bit is learning or practicing coding. The micro bit does a good job of this because that you don't need to worry about attaching other things for your program to work. As well as the fact that the Micro:Bit can use block coding to allow you to get a concept coded without learning how to code JS or Python.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Real World Concepts</h2>
      <p>While the micro bit is used for education it can also be used for other rudimentary coding projects. Some of these include alarm systems, step counters & Identification Systems.</p>
