      <h2>How did I decide on the stopwatch</h2>
      <p>First, I needed to find something that I could outdo myself with. In the previous assignment I had learned arrays which pushed my abilities to their limits. So I needed to something that would be bigger than that. After much contemplation I decided I would do a stopwatch.
      <br>
        <br>
      I chose a stopwatch for the following reasons. Firstly, there is know built in way to display time that has passed so I would need to figure out how to combine other elements to make a number tick up. Next, I had never attempted something like this before so I figured it would be a good challenge. Finally, I felt that I could implement what I learned from this project to other personal projects. With my idea out of the way, I could begin.

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>I wanted my stopwatch to do the following things</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Count up every second.</li>
        <li>Stop/Start.</li>
        <li>Reset.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, I set out working on a way to get this to happen</p>
